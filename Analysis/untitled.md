Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?


Based on the plots above, we can see a long-term strengthening of the Japanese Yen against the Dollar. 
There does seem to be some more medium, 1-3 year consistent trends, but on a daily basis, there are a lot of short-term ups and downs. However,
based on this time series, I would buy the yen now.


Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?

Volotility is expected to increase.


Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?

Time series can identify the noise elements, and unique movements and separate them from the overall trend.
This is not to say that it will give you meaningful results all the time, but you could use that general trend information, and the unique movements that were observed
in order to conduct meangingfull analysis.
